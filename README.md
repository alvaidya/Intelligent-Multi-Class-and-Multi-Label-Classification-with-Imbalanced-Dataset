# Intelligent Multi-Label Classification

## Overview
This project implements advanced **multi-class** and **multi-label classification** techniques, combined with clustering and imbalanced learning strategies.  
It demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to complex datasets while ensuring fair performance across all classes.

## Techniques Used
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classification  
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** for imbalanced datasets  
- **Pipelines with GridSearchCV** for model optimization and hyperparameter tuning  
- **K-Means Clustering** for unsupervised learning tasks  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Hamming Loss, Exact Match, Silhouette Score

## Key Results
- Improved classification accuracy and robustness on imbalanced datasets with SMOTE  
- Designed end-to-end ML pipelines for streamlined training and evaluation  
- Demonstrated unsupervised clustering with meaningful group separation

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Imbalanced-learn  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

## Applications
- Multi-label text or image classification  
- Medical diagnosis with overlapping symptoms  
- Recommendation systems with multiple categories  
- Data exploration with clustering for hidden patterns
